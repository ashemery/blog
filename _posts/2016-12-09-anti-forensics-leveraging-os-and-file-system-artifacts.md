Hola,

I know it seems that the zone has been abandoned for a year, and that is why I didn’t want the year to end without posting anything. Anyway, this [presentation](https://www.ashemery.com/docs/speaks/Ali-AntiForensics.pdf) has been covered in Feb-2016, and thought why not share it with the DFIR community, maybe it will be useful to someone out there.

Presentation title: [Anti-Forensics: Leveraging OS and File System Artifacts](https://www.ashemery.com/docs/speaks/Ali-AntiForensics.pdf).

It doesn’t cover all the anti stuff, but it is a good start.

Enjoy…
