During this semester, which technically ends on Sunday 11:59 pm (5/5/2019), I taught this course at the college for a nice group of students. The course has nothing secret and no zero days were found LOL.  But, still I think it was fun, but a fire hose of information to go over in a 5-weeks class! I might release the labs and I might not do that, not until the end of 2019. But anyway, just wanted to have it referred to here.

The list of topics covered could be found [here](https://github.com/ashemery/exploitation-course).

That’s all for now!
