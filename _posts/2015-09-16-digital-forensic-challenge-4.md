**The Case:**

A company’s web server has been breached through their website. Our team arrived just in time to take a forensic image of the running system and its memory for further analysis. The files can be found below:

1- System Image: [here](https://mega.co.nz/#!0FY2jC6C!IrWGIEicYrlodQnfttXLhbCFD551plWigzd097ue25s)

2- System Memory: [here](https://mega.co.nz/#!1UpjkTab!RP_QeooLaxA7bixLxkHLIqhWKfQ9G_0M58NSUchRn68)

3- Hashes: [here](https://mega.co.nz/#!FFZHBZxI!7vGrnQzN4ZK_XwcKBu8mQKzIKcdE7tM3rQ_zTqJQ6-U)

4- Passwords = **DFChallenge@s4a**

To successfully solve this challenge, a report with answers to the tasks below is required:

1- What type of attacks has been performed on the box?

2- How many users has the attacker(s) added to the box, and how were they added?

3- What leftovers (files, tools, info, etc) did the attacker(s) leave behind? (assume our team arrived in time and the attacker(s) couldn’t clean & cover their tracks)

4- What software has been installed on the box, and were they installed by the attacker(s) or not?

5- Using memory forensics, can you identify the type of shellcode used?

6- What is the timeline analysis for all events that happened on the box?

7- What is your hypothesis for the case, and what is your approach in solving it?

8- Is there anything else you would like to add?

**Bonus Question:**

what are the directories and files, that have been added by the attacker(s)? List all with proof.

**Important Note:**

The case MUST be solved using open source and free tools only (NO EnCase, FTK, etc) are allowed.
