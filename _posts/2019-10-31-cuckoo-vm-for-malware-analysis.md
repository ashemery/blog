If you do not want to put some time in installing your own [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/) for different reasons, then you could just download the Virtual Machine (VM) that I have prepared. What I’ve done is get Cuckoo to run in a VM, so you might be asking what does that mean? Well, it means that first Cuckoo is running in a VM and second that Cuckoo will be running its analysis within another VM. Yes, a VM in another VM or what is technically called “[Nested Virtualization](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/N/nested-virtualization.html)“. I used [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/) for my VM, but since I’ve exported it to OVA, then you should be good to just import and run.

Things you need:

1. The VM from [here](https://github.com/ashemery/CuckooVM).

2. Username: **user1** & Password: **forensics**

3. Add a Windows ISO to your Cuckoo VM

4. Submit a sample and get some results…

Enjoy…
