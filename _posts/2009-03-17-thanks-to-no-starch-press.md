Hi,

The last month I bought a book from **No Starch Press** titled: [The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition](http://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm)

![](/assets/img/posts/2009/artofexpl-book.jpg)

I got the book which I don’t need to write a review about it, you can find many great reviews about the book using Google or reading these two reviews: [Link1](http://www.itworld.com/hacking-art-exploitation-nlsunix-080404) | [Link2](http://www.ethicalhacker.net/content/view/224/2/)

What happened is that I received the book but unfortunately the CD inside the book was broken

I wondered what to do !!! I went to [No Starch Press](http://www.nostarch.com) website, and took a look at the [About](http://www.nostarch.com/about.htm) page. There was a wonderful full detail explanation what to do if you have the same case as mine (i.e: broken CD). So I mailed them and told them about my situation, they asked me for book details (serial no) and a shipping address. I mailed them that, and after 3 weeks I received a brand NEW CD shipped to me for free ::bgrim::

I really wish to thank [No Starch Press](http://www.nostarch.com) for their customer support and follow up with my case and for sure they shall do the same with others too. Thanks **No Starch** for that I really appreciate it, and I highly recommend you guys out there to go ahead and buy their books, they are really a geeks entertainment

Best regards,

B!n@ry
