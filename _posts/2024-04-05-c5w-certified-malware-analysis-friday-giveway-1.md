Last week’s Friday Giveway was the C5W Certified Malware Analysis Course that can be found [here](https://academy.cyber5w.com/courses/C5W-Certified-Malware-Analyst). This is an amazing course for those interested in doing Malware Analysis and it has over 45 hands-on labs. These are instructional and guided labs to help the reader not only do malware analysis, but understand what they are actually doing.

To win the course, you have to retweet my post (last week’s post is [here](https://twitter.com/binaryz0ne/status/1773824531238355287)) and that’s it. I do not require you to follow my account or anything, just a simple RETWEET!

What I do, is I copy the names of those who participated, put them into a Python List and then use a simple program to randomly select the winner. Last week’s winner was [j0sN3T](https://twitter.com/j0sN3T).

Don’t miss these [giveaways](https://twitter.com/binaryz0ne)!
