Hello,

I finally was able to play with the GOAD v2 project and configure it to run within a single VM using nested Virtualization.

From the developer of the project

“GOAD is a pentest active directory LAB project. The purpose of this lab is to give pentesters a vulnerable Active directory environment ready to use to practice usual attack techniques.”

Important to note, that I did not create this project or collaborate on it, so all credits to the developer, the only thing I did was prepare it to run within a single VM. All the thanks to [M4yFly](https://twitter.com/M4yFly) for his work and efforts.

If you need this VM, please send me an email. My email can be found in my Twitter bio [here](https://twitter.com/binaryz0ne).

To read more about the project, please check the references below.
