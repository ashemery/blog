Well lots say I have a Multi-Processor Machine how can I really use both processors efficently ? I shall say that there are lots of ways, one of them is through xjobs.

xjobs, takes more than one process from a Standard Input from a script or just straight from the CLI. The software shall take each process and pass it to a processor, and this shall be just as doing Load Balancing on the CPU’s.

This shall finally let you feel of the quality of Multi Processing by the nature of Parallel Processing.

To download the software from [here](http://www.maier-komor.de/xjobs.html)
